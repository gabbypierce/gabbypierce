Hi, I'm Gabby Pierce! I'm currently pursuing a 3+1 Software Engineering Cybersecurity program, which allows me to earn my Bachelor's in Software Engineering in 3 years and my Master's in Cyber security in just 1 year. Along with my passion for tech, I'm also an athlete on the Acrobatics and Tumbling team. I'm actively involved in Girls Who Code, the Student Athlete Advisory Committee, and I serve as the Quinnipiac Athletics Community Service Coordinator. I'm passionate about project managing, cybersecurity, business intelligence and making a positive impact both on and off the mat!
